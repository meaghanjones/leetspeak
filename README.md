# Leetspeak, Created June 27th 2016

#### By _**Meaghan Jones and Rony Nasr**_

## Description 

Leetspeak uses an alternative alphabet of numbers and symbols to replace various letters in words. For example, "leet" becomes "1337" and "Epicodus" might become "3p1c0duz".

## Specs 

Write a Ruby method on the String class that converts a string using some of the rules of Leetspeak:

1) The letter "e" should be replaced with "3".
2) The letter "o" should be replaced with "0".
3) The capital letter "I" (but not the lower case, "i") should be replaced with "1".
4) All instances of "s" should be replaced with "z" UNLESS it is the first letter of the word.

Here is a sample of input and output:

*In: "Don't you love these 'String' exercises? I do!" 
*Out: "D0n't y0u l0ve theze 'String' exercizez? 1 d0!"
